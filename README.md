# mesen2vgm
A [Mesen 2](https://mesen.ca) script for recording VGM files. For now, it can only be used on systems with the Game Boy DMG sound chip.

Also kind of works on GBA, but the Wave channel might not sound correctly as I don't know if there are any VGM players that emulate the extra features (banking and double-width waveforms).

## Usage
Load the script, press P on your keyboard to begin recording, press O to stop. Output should be in your LuaScriptData/mesen2vgm (if script wasn't renamed) folder titled `test.vgm`.
